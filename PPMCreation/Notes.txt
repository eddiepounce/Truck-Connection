(10k resistor) does not seem to be needed for MFU or Receiver
when connecting to Nano as input for PWM lines.

MFU trailer connector is used as sink for light inputs.
With 10k pull-up resistor it takes 0.4mA (or 0.2mA for rear light function).

Note:  On Nano pins A6 & A7 and Analog Input only.
		It appears they do NOT have internal pull-up resistors!!!!
		despite the documentation indicating that they do.
		So hard-wired 10K pull-ups are used just on these 2 pins.

Pin D5	for Channel 5	Input is NOT USED. 
	- Reversing Light via Opto Isolator in LED circuit(pull-up needed) -
	The truck Reversing Light is only on when moving - for the 
	Ch5 trailer feed the same setting as the Front/Back Camera is used,
	worked out by monitoring the Throttle.

Gearbox Control
	decide if stick or switch being used for Gearbox control
	channel 6 (left) switch - hold down (high) for 3 seconds to toggle
	gearboxControlToggle = LOW == stick; HIGH == switch;
